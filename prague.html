        Prague is an old and charming city. It has more than a milion
        inhabitants, lies on the beautiful meandres of the river Vltava, it's
        roofs are red and streets are narrow, and not only it has hundreds of
        spires but also hundreds of great deeds and gripping tales stored in its
        rich historical possesion. So for instance, did you know that the large
        stone blocks of the notorously famous Charles Bridge were grouted by a
        substance from eggs? And did you know that Prague has a history of
        throwing its councilors out of the windows of the townshall and that it
        didn't happen only once?
