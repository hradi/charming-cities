      <h2>How to present Prague</h2>
      <p>
        Prague is an old and charming city. It has more than a million
        inhabitants, it lies on the meandres of the river Vltava, its roofs are
        red and streets are narrow, and there are thousands of random tales and
        great deeds stored in its rich historical possesion. So for instance,
        did you know that there was a wall built by hungry people, called the
        Hungry wall, built only to provide work for the starving and unemployed,
        so they had money for living? And did you know we have a history of
        throwing our councilors out of the windows of the Town hall, and that we
        have done this three times in only two hundreds years?
      </p>
      <p>
        Prague is an old city and if you want to fully engage in its beauty, you
        need to lose yourself in its large squares and narrow streets. If I were
        to recommend places that you must see, I would do it geographically
        because there is nothing more magical to me in Prague, than the fact
        that you can consequently walk through all its history.
      </p>
      <h3>The Old Town</h3>
      <p>
        Whether you're an antiquity lover or an admirer of the modern times,
        start by roaming the Old Town, and you will have no regrets. The best
        way to get there is by your feet. There is a building of great cultural
        value in Prague, standing in the front of a kilometer long Wenceslaw
        square. It's the National Museum, wihtin its walls is stored history,
        and outside its walls, history happens. The Wenceslaw square hosted many
        significant demonstrations throughout the centuries, as well as in the
        recent times, and with its symbolical value, it lies on the edge of
        culture, history and modern city life.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can walk down the Wenceslaw square, turn left and encounter another
        significant street, Národní třída, at the end of which stands the
        majestic National theater with its golden roof and heavy wide stone
        blocks. Before you reach this iconic building, though, your attention
        will be drawn to the new scene of the Nation theatre, distinctive
        architectonal piece of brutalism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking a few steps back, you can decide to turn the other way, already
        back at the top of the Wenceslaw square. If you turned your head to the
        right, you would see a building in distance, and if you walk one of the
        streets on the side, eventually, you reach the Prague main train
        station. To see its tall and gentle iron constructions leaning above the
        rileways, you would have to go inside and find your way to the
        platforms. Perhaps, explore the insides if you decide to explore another
        czech city. When you pass the train station building and walk through a
        parc, you encounter a tram station. If you go turn to the left and
        proceed walking, another train station appears in front of you, but this
        time you only need to peek in to spot the atmosphere and the trails.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless you're a train lover, you leave both stations behind, and
        continue walking between two rows of tenement houses. Very soon you need
        choose direction again, and left side it is. Another complex square
        opens in fron of you, Náměstí Republiky, the Republic square. Several
        buildings may catch your attention. There is a national bank, a famous
        theatre, two unique shopping malls and tramway trails cutting t center
        of the paved street without sidewalks. There is a tower, the Powder
        tower, another remarcable monument you might have heard about. If you
        walk beneath it, you find yourself in Celetná street, which will lead
        you to the Old Town Square, the one, you have most likely come to see.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Old Town square is the place where Prague people throw others out of
        windows. The Towns hall, large temple and other significant building may
        catch your eye, just as you walk into the large space of the square. The
        most famous piece of work is the astronomical clock, called Orloj, bound
        by legends about poor clocksman who was blinded by spiteful and
        avaricious town councilours. The clock moves nicely every full hour, so
        make sure to tackle your timing to not miss the show.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you're full of Old Town square, you can walk past a Nicolas Church
        to enter another square of Jan Palach, where the orchestral building
        Rudolfinum stands. Concerts are taking place there, official ceremonies,
        too. There is a bridge seemingly leading you closer to the Prague
        castle, but for the real experience, I recommend taking another rout.
        For deepre experience you can roam a bit the streets there, to see the
        new towns hall, the city library, and finally also the Nation library
        inside of a large and complex building called Clementinum, where jezuits
        used to have their schools and dorms, before it was publically redone to
        its current form. If you follow the wall of the gigant building, you get
        near to DAMA, theatre faculty of the academy of fine arts, then you pass
        the Salvator church and right in front of you rises a tall Prague tower
        and the Charles bridge behind it. Did you know that the date and time it
        was established at, gives the row of prime numbers from 1 to 9, and back
        to 1? 1357, 9. 7. 5:31 in the morning.
      </p>

      <h3>The Lesser Town</h3>
      <p>
        You have just walked the Charles bridge, admired Prague caste, all the
        spires and towers in the distance, the golden roof of the National
        theater, the river beneath you and its wide bed, and now, you stare at
        the gigant Prague caste, probably under the impression that the caste
        itself consists of on the two large spires that you see up there, which,
        in fact, is are only the towers of Saint Vit cathedral that stands
        inside of the castle's walls. You have climb a lot of stairs to get up
        there, but the view is worth every one of them. After you've seen all of
        the castle's squares (it has many) and the cathedral itself, you take a
        while to look around from one of the many viewpoints, and try to spot
        the buildings that you have already met, andd tips of churches that you
        passed. Churches and towers are great for orientation.
      </p>
      <p>
        You come back down from the castle and explore how the atmosphere of the
        Lesser Town differs. There is a hill called Petřín, where the
        aforementioned Hungry wall is to be seen, and mainly, there's a historic
        cableway that takes you up the hill, where you can visit an astronomy
        building, famous just as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have had enough of looking around, you can calmly walk back down
        and proceed to the center of Smíchov. Smíchov is one of the younger city
        quarters, where people live more than tourists, and
